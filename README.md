### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Simon! I'm a PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University :book:

I'm also a PhD resident at X - the Moonshot Factory :rocket:

For my thesis and work, I design photonic integrated circuits :bulb:. This means I draw and assemble pretty shapes that control light on chips. 
* For my PhD the goal is to make artificial brains that use light (neuromorphic photonics) 
* For work we design optical communication systems :satellite:

To do this I use and contribute to open-source projects as much as possible, see repos below!
