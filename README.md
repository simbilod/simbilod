### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Simon! I'm a PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University, and also a PhD resident at X - the Moonshot Factory :rocket:

For my thesis and work, I design photonic integrated circuits. This means I draw pretty shapes that control light on chips. For my PhD the goal is to make artificial brains that use light (neuromorphic photonics), and for work we design optical communication systems.

To do this I use and contribute to open-source projects as much as possible, see repos below!
